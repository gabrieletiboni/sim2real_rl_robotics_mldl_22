# Sim-to-Real transfer of Reinforcement Learning policies in robotics

This repository contains the code template for the reinforcement learning-based course project of the MLDL course.

- Local version

### 1. Local Version

Install dependencies:
- Install [MuJoCo](https://mujoco.org/) and the python mujoco interface following the instructions here: https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py
- Install [gym](https://gym.openai.com/): `pip install gym`

Run the python files and the MuJoCo physics engine on your local machine (Windows is somewhat deprecated).


### 2. Colab Version

Use https://colab.research.google.com/ to run your experiments.

- Download the files contained in the colab_template folder
- Load the `.ipynb` files on [https://colab.research.google.com/](colab) and follow the instructions on each script to run the experiments

NOTE: while the Colab version is easier to set up, it is currently **not** possible to render the simulator on Colab and see it action. We recommend that each group manages to play around with the visual interface of the simulator at least once, to best understand what is going on with the Hopper environment.
